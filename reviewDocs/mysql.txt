Returns

StyleID     ID       RANK      ROW_NUMBER      DENSE_RANK
----------- -------- --------- --------------- ----------
1           1        1         1               1
1           1        1         2               1
1           1        1         3               1
1           2        4         4               2

You can see that for the three identical rows the ROW_NUMBER increments, the RANK value remains the same then it leaps to 4. 
DENSE_RANK also assigns the same rank to all three rows but then the next distinct value is assigned a value of 2.

Select duplicate rows from the table

SELECT [FirstName], 
    [LastName], 
    [Country], 
    COUNT(*) AS CNT
FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee]
GROUP BY [FirstName], 
      [LastName], 
      [Country]
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Delete duplicate rows from the table

DELETE FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee]
    WHERE ID NOT IN
    (
        SELECT MAX(ID) AS MaxRecordID
        FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee]
        GROUP BY [FirstName], 
                 [LastName], 
                 [Country]
    );
