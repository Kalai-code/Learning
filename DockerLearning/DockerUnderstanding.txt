Docker:
    Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications.
    Docker helps in packaging the application to run on any machines.

Container:
    It is an isolated environment for running an application.
    Allows to run multiple applications in isloation.
    Lightweight(does not require full OS)
    Containers share OS(kernel) of the host.
    Containers are like processes(special process) running on the machine.

Virtual machines:
    Virtual machines is an abstration of a machine or physical hardwares. We can run several VMs in a pysical machine.
    For example, in mac we can run windows and linux VMs. This is achieved by a tool called Hypervisor. Hypervisor is a software to create and manage VMs.
    Some of the Hypervisers are VMware, VirtualBox etc

Docker Architecture:
    Docker uses client-server architecture. Client talks to server(Docker Engine) using REST API.

Development Workflow:
    Application + Dockerfile is packaged into an image.
    Image contains A cut down OS, A runtime environment(Eg: Python), Application files, Third party libraries, Environmental Variables etc
    When the image is built, we tell docker to create a container. Container is a special process because it has its own file system provided by the image.
    The image gets loaded in the container and we run the container in development machine.
    Docker to Docker hub(similar to git and github) and the image can be run in any other test/prod environment.

steps to build image:
1. Create a folder and navigate to the folder using mkdir <foldername> and cd <foldername>
2. Create an app in the folder with the code using code . (opens the folder in VSCode)
3. Add Dockerfile file inside the folder and mention the steps for installation and execution
4. Create a build using the following command
    docker build -t <imagename> .(foldername)
    The above command builds the image.
5. To view all the images in the folder use
    docker images or 
    docker image ls --> for short list
6. To run docker,
    docker run <imagename> --> this command runs the docker image for any directory.
